            Why am I getting so many short steel factories and no long steel
            factories in my promotion recommendation?
          </div>
          <div className="faq-answer">
            The Toon API Calculator currently ranks all facilities by time per
            total facility points (merits, cogbucks, etc). This calculation
            results in the algorithm ignoring long steel factories since it
            believes that short steels are a more efficient use of your time. In
            the future, I plan to add the option to switch between the current
            algorithm and one that will recommend skipped facilities like long
            steel factories.
